## Why Arcane?

I created Arcane because I couldn’t find a Docker UI that was both simple and feature-rich enough for my needs. Every feature in Arcane is something I personally found missing or cumbersome in other tools. As the project grew, it became clear that others might benefit from it too.  
If you have suggestions, feedback, or feature requests, please open an issue or submit a pull request!
