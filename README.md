> [!IMPORTANT]
> All Arcane repos are in the process of moving to the [@getarcaneapp](https://github.com/getarcaneapp) org on GitHub. This means the images used for Arcane for all future releases (past 1.7.2) will use a new image repo and tag.
> Currently only the templates and website repos have moved. The main repository will be moved in the coming days.
