# Security Policy

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

Thank you for helping us keep this project secure!

If you discover a security vulnerability (such as a CVE), **please do not file an issue on GitHub**. Publicly disclosing vulnerabilities in GitHub issues can put users at risk before the problem is addressed.

Instead, please report vulnerabilities directly to our security team by emailing **[ksm@ofkm.us](mailto:ksm@ofkm.us)**.

We will review your report promptly and work to resolve the issue as quickly as possible. When submitting a report, please include as much detail as possible, such as:

- A description of the vulnerability.
- Steps to reproduce the issue.
- Potential impact of the vulnerability.
- Any suggested fixes or mitigations.

We appreciate your responsible disclosure and your assistance in keeping this project secure.

For non-security-related issues, feel free to use the GitHub issue tracker as usual.
